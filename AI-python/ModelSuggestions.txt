Future Improvements:

Custom Model Training: Fine-tune BERT/RoBERTa on legal documents
Legal-Specific Models: Use models trained on legal corpora
Database Integration: Store extracted patterns for learning
Confidence Scoring: Improve accuracy metrics
Document Type Detection: Auto-detect contract types

The system provides a solid foundation that you can iterate on. You can improve accuracy by:

Adding more legal term definitions
Refining regex patterns based on your document types
Training custom models on your specific legal documents
Adding feedback loops to improve extraction accuracy
